# TODO

- replace js-yaml with a more reliable and modern alternative
- use class for global secretProps handling rather than passing them as attributes
- op session and chosen env variables' persistence (local vault)
- retain only several backup instances (like 5 by default?) of each file, no need to clutter fs too much
- decouple profile names from profile output file name specifier
